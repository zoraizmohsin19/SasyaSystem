An Automatic Irrigation Control system has been designed to facilitate the automatic supply of adequate of water from a reservoir to field or domestic crops in all agricultural seasons. One of the objectives of this work is to see how human control could be removed from irrigation and also to optimize the use of water in the process.  The work can be grouped into four subsystems namely; power supply, sensing unit, control unit and pumping subsystems which make up the automatic irrigation control system. A better way to monitor the environmental conditions and effective use of water to avoid wastage is by the use of sensor network. The advantages of automatic irrigation to the plants include saving money, water, conservation of labour and overall convenience.

Biofloc Technology (BFT) is considered as new “blue revolution” since nutrients can be continuously recycled and reused in the culture medium, benefited by the minimum or zero-water exchange. The Biofloc systems are becoming increasingly popular as a low-cost means of cleaning the culture water of fish farms while simultaneously providing an additional source of feed. The Biofloc systems bank on photosynthesis to convert uneaten feeds, faeces and excess nutrients into food. While breaking down toxic ammonia and nitrates into free nitrogen. The Biofloc systems reduce the spread and effectiveness of pathogens while simultaneously improving fish health through better water quality and support feed availability. The systems can give us a natural way of producing more fish sustainably, while concurrently improving farm profitability.

The Greenhouse Control System can reduce manual work, promote control precision and improve response speed. Auto-control is the tendency of artificial greenhouses. The Green House automatically controlling all the factors that affect plant growth. The data from the greenhouse will be measured by the sensor and the data that are collected will be sending to the receiver. The data that has been read will be displayed on the LCD screen. By using this system, the process of monitoring is easier and it is also cheaper for installation and maintenance process."
